### To run:
The simplest way is just to open `index.html` in the browser

However, if you want the page to automatically update on changes, you should install node.js (https://nodejs.org/en) and do the following
1. clone repo
2. change directories `cd ./SHOW-US-YOUR-SCREENS`
3. install dependencies `npm install`
4. run live server `npm run start`

### edit lineup
edit `index.html` to edit the lineup

### Start and stop timer
Pressing `spacebar` on the keyboard starts the timer (or restarts it if already going)
Pressing `q` on the keyboard goes back to the lineup view
